Hi, I'm Patryk, a software engineer from Poland.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST in Krakow. In first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography, leading to my graduation project being a proof-of-work cryptocurrency implementation from scratch. Later, during my Master's degree, I switched focus to machine learning - in my final thesis I studied the generalization capabilities of deep neural nets through the lens of geometries of loss function manifolds.

### CV
