#####

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patryk, a software engineer based in Poland.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST in Krakow. In first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography, leading to my graduation project being a proof-of-work cryptocurrency implementation from scratch. Later, during my Master's degree, I switched focus to machine learning - in my final thesis I studied the generalization capabilities of deep neural nets through the lens of geometries of loss function manifolds.

I used to work as a software engineer at Akamai, where I was responsible for CDN data pipelines.

Later, I worked as a backend engineer at Google, where I developed LLM inference and agent APIs in Cloud.
