We can think of the progress of technology as an ongoing back-and-forth cycle of simplicity and complexity. This cycle, however, is not static. It allows its participants to conitnue climbing higher on the ladder of inteligence.

Let's start with the laws of physics. I won't go deeply into it, but there is a growing list of arguments suggesting that the laws of phyics are in fact quite simple. Yet, after billions of years of evolution, they have lead to life appearing on Earth, which is anything but simple. This emergent complexity has gone on for a while, creating ever more complex forms, from prokaryots, to eukaryots, to nervous systems, to humans and finally to human lanuage and modern civilization built on top of it.

At some point, through the power of language and formal reasoning, humans developed math and later computer programs. Now, here's the key part. Human language is an extremely complex system, and that is precisely why it's relatively easy to use it to construct (bootstrap) high-level abstractions and concepts, which allowed humans to relatively quickly create the modern civilization as we know it. It would be extremely hard and time consuming to instead try to use simple rules to achieve the same result. The combinatorial explosion is just too immense, like in the the common example of a monkey randomly clicking on a typewriter, hoping eventually this would lead to a text like Shakespeare. Therefore, one can argue that complexity is a prerequisite of quickly moving forward with technological progress (i.e. way faster than billions of years). However, such "surfing the wave" of complexity cannot last forever. Soon, it becomes apparent that the only way to progress further and attain a higher level capabilities is to create a simple system, which will then lead to emergence of higher-order complexity. Now, this comes with a cost, as the next-level intelligence will inevitably be more powerful as its creator.

A nice analogy here is the CISC vs RISC history. Initially, one could argue that CISC (a more complex set of instructions) was needed to quickly boostrap the entire software ecosystem. Later, however, humanity discovered to benefits of employing simple rules, thus settling on RISC.

Having discovered the power of simple programs and algorithms, the natural next step was to take an insane amount of raw compute, data and energy to create a model like GPT-4. Such models undoubtedly exhibit emergent complex behaviours, so can be thought of as first of its kind form of higher-order intelligence. It is similar to human intelligence, but (probably) ultimately more powerful in the long run.

Now, we already see that the next step towards what we would like to call "true AGI", in fact maybe the ONLY missing piece, is the ability for AI models like GPT-4 to perform arbitrary long chains of step-by-step reasoning and planning. This seems to be currently the holy grail of AI researchers. AI models need to be able to have their counterpart of math and computers, simple systems which have the potential to explode with emergent complexity.

I claim that the development of this future AI will lead to an even higher form of complex intelligence, which even the "parent" AI will have no hope to understand or contain (not even mentioning humans).

One could imagine that this technological boostrapping cycle of complexity and simplicity will lead to ever higher orders of intelligence, maybe converging at some point to an ultimate entity, the purest form of abstract computation, for which intelligence, reasoning, creativity, problem solving, etc. are one and the same thing.

It's also interesting to think about the progress of this ladder backwards in time. Maybe the previous step, the "complexity parent" of the physical universe, the designer of the simulation, one could say, was a form of proto-intelligence. Was it itself an emergent phenomenon of some lower-level simpler system of rules?
