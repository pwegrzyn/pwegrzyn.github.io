When you're asked to think about the most famous and revolutionary math ideas in recent centuries, there's a high probabability that you'll think of either [Cantor's diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument), proving that some infinities are bigger than others, or [Gödel's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), which shows that a formal system can contain statements that are not provable within the system, or [Russell's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox), which suggests that some sets are actually not allowed to exist, or [Turing's halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), which proves that you cannot write computer program that, for all possible input program source codes, decides whether they stop or go into an infinite loop. Indeed, these theorems directly or indirectly lead to the development of entirely new branches of mathematics and questioned our understanding of the formal laws governing our universe. Personally, I was always fascinated that such simple statements can tell us so much about the limitations and perplexities of logic. I was also intrigued that all these theorems are structurally very close to each other. It almost feels like they're special cases of some deeper truth underpinning the foundations of mathematics.

A few months ago, during a casual learning session on Category Theory and functional programming, I've stumbled upon Lawvere's fixed point theorem. At first, I didn't really see the connection between this seemingly uninteresing theorem and the aformentioned paradoxes. Later, however, I was directed by [this](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/39626/is-there-a-general-setting-for-self-reference) mathoverflow answer to the phenomenal paper by Noson S. Yanofsky - *"A Universal Approach to Self-Referential Paradoxes, Incompleteness and Fixed Points"*. I highly recommend giving it a read. It's not an particularly easy read, by certainly digestible after some time. I was stunned by how one theorem can caputrue in such an elegant way the richness of so many aspects of logic and math in general. For me, this was a strong argument in favour of Category Theory being a fundamental unification of not only most of mathematics, but also computer science and possibly physics (more on that subject [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~erabin/The%20Categorical%20Language%20of%20Physics.pdf)).

I will not go into the technical details of this theorem in this brief post, since I don't feel yet qualified to explain it to the general public in a comprehensible way, and also because others already did a phenomenal job in this regard.

Instead, I recommend you to go through these resources:

* A very recent and approachable video lecture by Noson S. Yanofsky himself - [Self-Referential Paradoxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuzePhMPBxw)
* The original paper by the same author - [A Universal Approach to Self-Referential Paradoxes, Incompleteness and Fixed Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305282)
