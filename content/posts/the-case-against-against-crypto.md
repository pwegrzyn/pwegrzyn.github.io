Over the recent months I've come across a lot of negative comments aimed at the entire Crypto space, blaming Bitcoin (and other projects) for seemingly all the evil that's been present in the news: ransomware attacks rate increases, global warming, retail investor scams, etc. The general impression one could get after being presented with such allegations is that Blockchain is simply a useless waste of energy at best and dangerous criminal activity accelerator at worst. So, the action to take here is clear: we should just ban all Crypto projects (or practically regulate them out of existance by banning Crypto-to-Fiat exchanges), abandon research in this area and simply forgot about this "Internet money" stuff, right?

I first heard about Bitcoin around 2015, and at that time I thought that it was a cool idea - entirely digital money with no central control. I didn't dive deep into the technology side, so I pretty much forgot about it after some time and went on with life. During the 2nd year in college, after taking classes in Distributed Systems, I read some technical papers about Bitcoin and Blockchains in general. It is at this point that I really got hooked and started to realize just how big of a revolution this probably was. A globally distributed database with consensus mechanisms enforced via the law of supply and demand. One could even go as far as to say that Bitcoin is to the global financial system, what capitalism was to economics. No more central planning, no more 100% trust for the people in power, no more middle men. Instead, a system in which everyone contributes to the whole by simply following the natural insticts of egoism and personal gain. That was my thinking at that time, which eventually lead me to taking facultative classes in cryptography and game theory. I even decided to pick a Blockchain implementation with educationmal visualizations as my Bachelor's thesis.

Since then, I become a bit more cold headed on this matter. I still think that Blockchain (or Bizantine fault tolerant distributed consensus in general) is one of the greatest innovations of our time (next to Deep Learning, Quantum Computing and the Metaverse), but I also realized that the transition to a economy/society based on trustless smart contracts will not happen over night. In fact, I acknowledge some of the shortcomings of Bitcoin mentioned above (especially concerning the egregious waste of energy of Proof-of-work and, of course, questionable scalability). But I refuse to accept a future in which we simply decide to forget or even ban Crypto. In my view, the benefits of Blockchains vastly outweight even their current limitations and drawbacks. We should, at the very least, try to continue working on the main issues blocking mainstream adoption (I'm looking at you, *scalability*) and possibly be a little bit more *audacious* in the roll out of practical solutions based on Blockchains in the coming years. If all goes well, the payout for the society will be huge. For the first time in our history, we will have the potential to create a future in which openly available smart contracts are running our business and institutions, in which everyone is on an equal footing and everyone can easily see the rules of the game. A future in which the fear of inflation is no longer. A future in which politicians are held accountable for their promises and court verdicts are more objective. A future without censorship and de-platforming. A better future.
