Hi ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Patryk, a software engineer from Krakow, Poland. Currently, I'm finishing my Master's degree in Computer Science at AGH-UST; in my thesis I'm studying the geometry of loss landscapes in neural networks. During my undergrad studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems (my Bachelor's thesis being a Blockchain implementation for cryptography classes). I also used to worked as a SWE at Akamai, where I was responsbile for data propagation systems. My interests are distributed systems (theory as well as practice in form of cloud native and decentralized Web3 technologies) and machine learning (mainly optimization and biologically plausible NNs). Casually I'm also into game engine development (Unreal, O3DE, custom) and quantum computing (as it's at the intersection of two of my favourite subjects - CS and physics). I also like to read a lot, watch movies and play some video games from time to time.
