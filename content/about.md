I'm Patryk, a software engineer based in Krakow, Poland. 

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST; in first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography (leading to my graduation project being a cryptocurrency implementation from scratch). Later, during my Master's degree, I mostly switched to machine learning; in my final thesis I studied geometries of loss function surfaces in deep neural nets.

I used to work as a software developer at Akamai Inc., where I was responsbile for data propagation and validation components of Akamai's global CDN.

My current interests are distributed systems (theory, cloud and decentralized Web3) and machine learning (mainly optimization, RL and biologically plausible DNNs). Casually I'm also into graphics engines (Unreal, O3DE and custom stuff using OpenGL/Vulkan).
