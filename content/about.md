#####

I'm Patryk, a software engineer based in Krakow, Poland. 

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST; in first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography (leading to my graduation project being a cryptocurrency implementation from scratch). Later, during my Master's degree, I mostly switched to machine learning; in my final thesis I studied geometries of loss function surfaces in deep neural nets.

I used to work at Akamai Technologies, where I was responsbile for data propagation and validation pipelines in Akamai's global CDN.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Google.
