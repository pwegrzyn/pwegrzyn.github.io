I'm Patryk, a software engineer based in Krakow, Poland. 

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST; in first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography (leading to my graduation project being a cryptocurrency implementation with visualizations and  attack scenarios). Later, during my Master's degree, I mostly switched to machine learning; in my final thesis I studied geometries of loss function surfaces in deep neural nets.

I used to work as a software developer at Akamai Inc., where I was responsbile for data propagation and validation components of Akamai's global CDN.

My current interests are distributed systems (cloud-native, actor models, decentralized Web3 technologies) and machine learning (mainly optimization, RL and biologically plausible ANNs). Casually I'm also into graphics engines (Unreal, O3DE and custom stuff using OpenGL/Vulkan).

In spare time I like to read a lot and play some video games from time to time.
