#####

Hi, I'm Patryk, a software developer based in Krakow, Poland. 

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST. In first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography, leading to my graduation project being a cryptocurrency implementation from scratch. Later, during my Master's degree, I switched focus to machine learning - in my final thesis I studied geometries of loss function surfaces in deep neural nets.

I used to work at Akamai Technologies, where I was responsbile for CDN data validation pipelines.

Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Google.
