Hi, I'm Patryk, a software engineer based in Poland.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST in Krakow. In first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography, leading to my graduation project being a cryptocurrency implementation from scratch. Later, during my Master's degree, I switched focus to machine learning - in my final thesis I studied various geometries of loss function surfaces in deep neural nets.
