You can just use one of the many beginner-friendly libraries/game-engines available in popular languages - for Python that would be for example PyGame, for Java - FXGL and for JS - GDevelop. Or, if you want to dive straight into more serious stuff, you could just go for Unity. However, soon you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that get more control over the graphics rendering pipeline (maybe you want to squeeze every bit of performance of your game or you just wish to implement a cool graphics effect) there&amp;rsquo;s currently still not better choice than picking good ol&amp;rsquo; C++ along with a low-level graphics library.</description></item></channel></rss>
