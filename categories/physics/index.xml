This cycle, however, is not static. It allows its participants to conitnue climbing higher on the ladder of inteligence.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the laws of physics. I won&amp;rsquo;t go deeply into it, but there is a growing list of arguments suggesting that the laws of phyics are in fact quite simple. Yet, after billions of years of evolution, they have lead to life appearing on Earth, which is anything but simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
