I obtained my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science from AGH-UST in Krakow. In first years of my studies I was mainly interested in distributed systems and cryptography, leading to my graduation project being a fully-fledged cryptocurrency implementation from scratch. Later, during my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I switched focus to machine learning - in my final thesis I studied the generalization capabilities of deep neural nets through the lens of geometries of loss function manifolds.</description></item></channel></rss>
